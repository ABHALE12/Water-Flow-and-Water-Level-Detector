********** Problem Statement *********

On our earth we can see major part is of water but total usable water on earth is only 2.5 % of which only 0.3% is in liquid form on surface.Hence water conservation in smarter way is necessity for our survival.

We can see in most of the places in urban areas water is in plenty but the population of that places are not aware of water conservation.Due to hectic schedule and high level of storage tanks fill out nd people are still not aware of water overflow . In cities or in rural areas sometimes water supply came at any time because of unaware of time we not get water.
