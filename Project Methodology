*********** Project Methodology **********

The circuit is designed to indicate three levels of water stored in the tank: low but not empty, half and full but not overflowing &  Control the Flow in the tank. When there is no water in the tank, all the LEDs are off as an indication that the tank is completely empty. When water level increases and touches the sensor, the Red LED will glow indicating that there is water within the tank. As the water level continues to rise and reaches half the tank, Yellow LED will glow. When the water in the tank rises to full First water come from pipe into the water level sensor.Inside the water level sensor there is rotor and using hall effect water flow detected. This sensation goes to the Arduino.The GSM module,Relay,LCD light is connected to the Arduino.When water tanks full or empty the Instruction will goes to the GSMÂ  module and LCD light goes green and notification will send to the mobile application called Blynk app.Using GSM module Mobile Number is added and only those person can able to get notification.Using Blynk Application we can control control the Water Flow When Tanks is Full.
